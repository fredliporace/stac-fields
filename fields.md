# fields.json

Remarks regarding the content of the `fields.json` file.

* Planet (prefix `pl:`) has a very extensive list of fields. @cholmes is working to come up with a shorter list.
* CARD4L for SAR (prefix `card4l:`) only lists the fields that need metadata more than just a label. This is to keep the fields.json small for now and not bloat it with a lot of fields from an extension that is pretty unstable.
* Sentinel (prefix `sentinel:`) is unofficial and a compilation from things found on the web. We may remove/change the fields in the future.
